                  The first step in any successful career transition is
                  self-assessment. Understanding your strengths, weaknesses,
                  interests, and values can provide a solid foundation for your
                  career change. Tools like personality tests, career
                  assessments, and skills inventories can be invaluable.

                <p className="mb-6">
                  Begin by listing your skills and interests. What do you excel
